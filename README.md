**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**

Sandsational is a web-based metasearch engine that helps users find nearby beaches based on their preferred weather and distance. Our system provides various search filters to best match user preferences and to help them find the perfect beach location. Along with detailed information on popular times to visit, hours of operation, warnings, and other important details that could impact the user's visit, our application also shows the available activities and entertainment options at each location. Sandsational makes it easy for users to plan the perfect beach day with ease.
