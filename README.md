##PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
We will develop a metasearch engine as a web-based application in which users will be able to find nearby beaches depending on the weather and distance of their choice and based on these findings see activities and entertainment available at the locations shown.  The system will provide search facilities to best optimize the userâ€™s preferences to match the perfect beach. Filters such as weather, and distance which will provide the user with activities at the site, popular times to visit, hours of operation, warnings, and other details about the place that could impact their visit.
